*The Beautiful Brain: The Drawings of Santiago Ramón y Cajal* runs September 5-December 3, 2017, at the Morris and Helen Belkin Art Gallery, Vancouver.

This exhibition presents the drawings of Santiago Ramón y Cajal, the Spanish pathologist who won the 1906 Nobel Prize in Physiology and Medicine for his contributions to the `***` of the nervous system. The `***` is, I assume, written by `***` who has written an accompanying `***` I have not read.

The drawings, executed over a period from the 1890s to the 1930s, display a `***`. What purpose they served for Cajal is not, as far as I can recall, a question the exhibition attempts to answer. Certainly some, such as a series contrasting the neural structures of the Cajal's neural theory of the brain and the earlier reticular theory, were didactic. Others bear signs of corrections which the `***` notes would not have been visible upon their reproduction. If the later transmission or `***` of other, more apparently `***`, `***` on display is known, they are not recorded here.

The `***` calls attention to the sensitivity of Cajal's to have been a talented and sensitive illustrator `***`. Cajal's `***`. As the `***` notes. The paucity of the `***` this `***`. As `***`. `***` On illustration of tightly packed neural members ***.

`***` -- all `***` of these are hallmarks of more awkwardly utilitarian medical illustration `***`.

Read rather uncharitably, `***`, hints by juxtaposition at a thesis about the influence of self-consciously "artistic" ***--`***` on Cajal's `***` which

An exception to the `***`.
