    <h3>CSS Trivia: Rotated table headers in 2019</h3>
    <div class="blog-post-meta">October 13, 2019</div>
    <div class="blog-post-excerpt">Recently I built an HTML report to aggregate the results of some automated jobs.

Since I didn’t find a current guide, I wanted to record what I settled on.
