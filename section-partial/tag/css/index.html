    <h3>CSS Trivia: Rotated table headers in 2019</h3>
    <div class="blog-post-meta">October 13, 2019</div>
    <div class="blog-post-excerpt">Recently I built an HTML report to aggregate the results of some automated jobs. The table headings being much longer than the table’s contents, I wanted to set the headings at a 45° angle. When I Googled for how to do this with CSS, the answers I got were all years old and involved some complications that seem to have become unnecessary. Since I didn’t find a current guide, I wanted to record what I settled on.
