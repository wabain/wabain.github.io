    <p>This emulation of the board game <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorry!_%28game%29" title="&ldquo;Sorry!&rdquo; on Wikipedia" target="_blank">&ldquo;Sorry!&rdquo;</a> was one of my earlier projects. It supported both AI and multiple human players as well as multi-turn undo/redo. It was written in Python using Tkinter for the user interface.</p>
    <p>(As the game is still manufactured by Hasbro, I have not released any code from this project publicly.)</p>
